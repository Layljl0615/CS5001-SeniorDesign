# Project Sought

I am seeking a project in which I am able to solve a real world problem.  I would prefer to not work with a company or other sponsor during this process so I am able to better exercise my creative freedom.  I would love to work with one other partner who is familiar with agile software development and is willing to contribute work on a regular basis such that we can iterate and improve off of feedback along the way.  I believe that by gathering feedback early on, we can create the best solution possible, and create one that actually solves the needs of the target audience, not what we or others perceive their needs to be.  I am hoping to utilize my established skillset with Python, AWS, or Javascript, but would also love the opportunity to learn new technologies.  I'm looking forward to a great senior year, and delivering a great project to cap it off!
