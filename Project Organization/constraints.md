# Project Constraints

  ### Major Constraints
    - Scope: With the removal of a team member the scope of the project, which was originally designed to be worked on by two people, will have to be modified to be able to be completed by me alone.
    - Time: For the same reasons as scope, the timeline of the project is going to be difficult for me to maintain by myself.
    - Expertise: I have only a basic level of understanding & experience with machine learning classifiers.  This project will require more than a base level of understanding to execute, therefore I will need to learn the related technologies.
    - Ethical/Legal: We will be scraping website data, and must ensure we are doing so in a way that is legal and does not infringe on copyright.  We also need to specify that this is not meant as real stock market advice, just to use as a reference

  ### Minor Constraints
    - Cost: There will be a small cost associated with hosting the website in the cloud that I am fine with paying.
    - Security: We are not going to be saving any truly sensitive user data, but sensitive information will be encryptyed as it is sent/received.
    - Diversity & Culture: This app will use the NYSE and be rpesented in english only, so data will only be local and relevant to users in the USA.
