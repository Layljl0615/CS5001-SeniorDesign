# Project Milestones:

  - Research & train classifier locally.  Confirm sentiment classification is working correctly. (Jan 2021)
  - Successfully scrape required data and feed to classifier for analysis. (Jan 2021)
  - Develop basic front-end components for navigation and application logic, display basic sentiment information. (Feb 2021)
  - Introduce display & graphing libraries to better show results of sentiment analysis, further improve front-end. (Mar 2021)
  - Host the project on a cloud platform such as AWS EC2. (Mar 2021)
  - Finalize interface, design, and functionality of all aspects of the site. (Apr 2021)
  - Complete end to end testing of application. (Apr 2021)

# Timeline:

  ### Project Tasks:

   1. Research classifiers and machine learning libraries in Python and JavaScript to decide best language to use for application logic. (Ian)
   2. Research how to properly display financial data & what data points to show. (Sal)
   3. Determine how to scrape financial news sources reliably & implement solution. (Sal)
   4. Create & train the classifier to identify sentiment of financial news. (Ian)
   5. Design responsive front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and assisting libraries. (Sal)
   6. Develop the page to page logic of the application. (Sal)
   7. Implement a graphing library to help display the results of the sentiment analysis. (Sal)
   8. Test classifier for accuracy of sentiment, and test front-end for useability. (Ian)
   9. Research best options and perform hosting of the application through a cloud provider. (Ian)
   10. Optimize calculation of sentiment scores to provide a lower wait time until results are determined. (Ian)

# Effort Matrix:

  Percentages represent the effort distribution between team members; 100% meaning that member will complete roughly 100% of the task individually.
